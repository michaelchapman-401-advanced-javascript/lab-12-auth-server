# OAuth Comparative Analysis

## OAuth Provider Name: AWS 

### Research Conducted By: Mike Chapman Ed DeArment

### Overall Score and Comments
#### Score (Out of 10): 7
#### General Comments
Starting out the usability was very clear and easy to follow however as the documentation went on it got harder to follow.
What took the longest was setup 

#### Pros
* Easy to follow at first
* A LOT of documentation
* Very DRY
* One Stop Shop

#### Cons
* As the documentation went on it got harder to follow. You can put it on an amazon kindle device
* Intemadating 

### Ratings and Reviews
#### Documentation
Like I said it was really clear at first, but then was more unclear. There was alot of documentation because and finding information can be hard at first.

#### Systems Requirements
Node and for the developer and AWS account. For a user an email address

#### Ramp-Up Projections
It has a steep learning curve at first and parsing the documentation can be a challenge. However, once you do it once or twice I think it can be really easy and ramping up would also be pretty easy as well.

#### Community Support and Adoption levels
AWS is the largest cloud computing avialable followed by Microsoft. I feel like there is alot of community support,
