Our OAuth service we chose was AWS Cognito. What we learned was that you first need to connect the app to AWS then create User Pools. Despite all AWS poor documentation there is a lot of information on OAuth and the first task is figuring out which guide to follow. The guide we followed was mostly pretty clear and I actually felt like it was probably one of the easier ones to follow. There were some minor issues with understanding but for the most part pretty straight forward. 

The first thing we learned was that Cognito is more of an OAuth manager. Meaning there are options where you can manage other OAuths like Facebook and Google. This alone makes Cognito pretty powerful. To explain, let’s say we have an app. With Cognito we can deal with the other OAuths giving developers more time to work on their project. 

The second thing we learned was that set up took a lot of time(creating user pools, and connecting the app to Cognito), but when it came time to actually code. The Google demo was much more coding. Meaning AWS took care of a lot of the work under the hood.

We weren't able to finish in the time allotted because we ran into some method issues with the post but if given an hour or two longer we probably would have finished.

All in all our experience with Cognito was very positive. And I feel like we learned a lot. The set up took some time but after that the amount of coding wasn’t that much. Understanding the process was also relatively easy, and the AWS documentation wasn’t that bad but you had to sift through a lot of information.
